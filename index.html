            <div id="DescL" class="lightbox-desc">The purpose of Super Tic Tac Toe is to be an enjoyable game riddled with strategy and pain as either you or your opponent struggle to play the game correctly and or forget which box to play in.  All in all Super Tic Tac Toe is an upgraded version of the childhood game Tic Tac Toe, the way its played is there 9 big boxes and 9 little boxes inside of those big boxes.  Our website allows the game to be played without needing the use of white board or a piece of paper.  Also our game allows the players to know where their next move is by showing it on the side navigation.  Our website is good for anyone that would have the desire to play Super Tic Tac Toe because we're made it very well and all bugs have been removed, there are easter eggs and it runs very well.
            
            The Index is inspired from Jacob's Tic Tac Toe project code, simply using grids of divs for the board. Sidebar is used for the game settings and control. CSS was done by mostly by Ivan, consisting of coloring, positioning, and other styles that we thought created a pleasant User Interface. The JavaScript was of course the hardest part, just allowing players to play in any space was a challenge in the start. We ended up with a solution that uses 9 board objects that each have 9 numbered spaces where the data can be stored. Another challenge we faced was trying to get forced boards to work, where players can only play in the correct board. Finally the win condition uses a combination of the board and other arrays that make it easy to iterate through each win condition in each board and allow us to see when someone has won a board and which one it was. Resetting the game uses HTML constructors to recreate the board from scratch. Scoring and other simple mechanics that just change variables were reused from other projects.
