All in all Super Tic Tac Toe is an upgraded version of the childhood game Tic Tac Toe, the way its played is there 9 big boxes and 9 little boxes inside of those big boxes.  Our website allows the game to be played without needing the use of white board or a piece of paper.  Also our game allows the players to know where their next move is by showing it on the side navigation.  Our website is good for anyone that would have the desire to play Super Tic Tac Toe because we're made it very well and all bugs have been removed, there are easter eggs and it runs very well.
